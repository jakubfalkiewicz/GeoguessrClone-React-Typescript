# GeoguessrClone-React-Typescript

I currently work on convertion of my GeoguessrCloneReact project from JavaScript to TypeScript  
I also changed the redux store to be more up-to-date with newest version 
The store needs some fixes, until that the production version available at https://geoguessr-clone.netlify.app/ is from my other repo: https://github.com/jakubfalkiewicz/GeoguessrCloneReact
