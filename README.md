# GeoguessrClone-React-Typescript

I currently work on convertion my GeoguessrCloneReact project from javascript to typescript  
I also changed the redux store to be more up-to-date with newest methods  
The store needs some fixes, until that the production version available at https://geoguessr-clone.netlify.app/ is from my other repo: https://github.com/jakubfalkiewicz/GeoguessrCloneReact
